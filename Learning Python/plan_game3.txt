  Starting paragraph - Thing

You are on your journey to Mars,
when suddenly, you look out
the window of the spaceship
and you see that part of your
ship has been hit by an astroid
gone loose from the astroid belt!
The ship is crashing, and you will
need to gather supplies in
the time that you can,
as well as contact your crew.
You know that you are going to
crash, so you need to get the
things that are going to help
you once you get onto the planet.
The first thing that you should do
is watch the emergency video
that was given to you for this
very situation.
In order to do this you are going
to need to find the video.
Hurry! But there is also a
combat system with the computer and we need
to use computer combat in order to stop it.
